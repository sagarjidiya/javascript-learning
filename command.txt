If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file.

Script files are attached to HTML with the src attribute:

<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>

-----
We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:
alert('Hello'); alert('World');

[must use -- ; -- before]
for multiple alert messeage use >> .forEach
alert('Hello');[1,2,3].forEach(alert)
